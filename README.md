# Tl;dr

The main idea of this app â€“ receiving and submitting feedback. And because of this, I skipped some things but the app works well for MVP.

#### Added:

- Ability to login and logout
- Ability to show the list of users who need to make feedback
- "Feedback wizard" which generate questions for a user using JSON data
- User can show received feedback (report will be generated by JSON data as well)
- Added Team and 404 pages (404 page will open after sign in)

#### Nice to have (if I have one extra day e.g.):

- Add REST API
- Add placeholders for pages
- Have to test app pages for accessibility
- Unit tests for stores

#### Extra info (nerdy stuff ðŸ¤“)

- Deployed to ZEIT
- Added `dependabot` and `AccessLint`
